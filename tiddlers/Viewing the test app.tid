(next: [[Deploying an app to Fly.io]])

I can now visit https://my-remote-env.fly.dev:3000/ to see the Hello world message!! 

My remote machine is running a node server on top of code-server and tired-proxy.

Now one thing to be cautious of here is that in this setup, this test app is actually served to the Internet. That could be a downside of just using Fly's https and code-server's password to protect our machine. 

I could run this exactly the same, not open port 3000 in the machine config, and use WireGuard or `fly proxy` to reach it. It's a judgement call in that case whether I should have used SSH or WireGuard in the first place.
