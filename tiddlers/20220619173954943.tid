annot: The anycast IP that'll let me access my VM is also associated with the app. The IP for a standard (non-Machines) Fly.io App gets allocated during the deploy process, but we're not running `fly deploy` on this app, so we need to [request this manually](https://fly.io/docs/flyctl/ips-allocate-v4/).
