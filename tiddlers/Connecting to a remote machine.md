### SSH or WireGuard
Need to set those up on the local machine. You can use VS Code Server, and/or tmux or various terminal panes of whatever flavour connected to the remote environment that way.

### HTTPS
In-browser IDEs are a thing right now. If I can serve my IDE as a web app over an HTTPS connection (with a trusted certificate), I don't need to set up SSH or WireGuard on my local machine to use it.

Whatever you think of being trapped inside a browser window, it's a thing you can do.
