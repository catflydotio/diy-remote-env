Right now, it says 

```
Install Flyctl - you'll need it.
Create an account with flyctl auth signup or login with flyctl auth login.
Run flyctl launch - create, configure, and deploy a new application
```
and then has a list of languages/frameworks you can deploy. It's not very clear in what way we support them; the  links are external. The sidebar does have language guides.
