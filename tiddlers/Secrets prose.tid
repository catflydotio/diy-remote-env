The demo stores the Fly token and code-server password as Fly secrets. These are available anywhere in the VM as environment variables. So we can set a GitHub token as a Fly secret too? I think you can auth code-server with GitHub but I don't know what the mechanics of that are (where it stores the file)
(Docker secrets)
